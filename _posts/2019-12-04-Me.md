I am passionate about best practices in Web Development.

I use this passion to drive DevOps workflows, creating maintainable code that empowers developers to focus on key innovative solutions.

I am an enthusiastic innovator, that can direct others to help bring my visions to reality. 

I am an original problem solver, and I am always looking for something new to learn, whilst having fun doing it.
