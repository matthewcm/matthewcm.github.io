# BIG DATA LDN
## 23-24 November 2019

I had a great time attending Big Data Ldn, I would definitely recommend going if you have any interest in #bigdata and would like to learn more about the solutions available to managing data, deciphering data, and leading with data.

The talks were great and visiting each of the individual booths was incredibly valuable. I gained a wider scope of what is available in the market of AI + ML, data cleaning and data analytics technologies.

I am excited to try out some of the new technologies that I saw, and to see what I will be able to build with them!
