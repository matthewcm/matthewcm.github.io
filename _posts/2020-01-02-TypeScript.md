# TypeScript

The typed JavaScript language that  brings extra documentation with the code that you write.

Typed, so writing code requires extra thought, which in turns creates well thought out, cleaner code.

When writing code in typescript, the begining is the hard part; you have the create the foundations of the application you expect to build. Similarly to how you would write a program using Test Driven Development. TDD and Typescript can work harmoniously.

With typescript you end up creating a well documented program that tells you exactly what the program is doing and what each function expects as inputs and outputs. This is essential for maintaining the system, and provides great documentation to collaborate with others. 

I believe TypeScript should be learnt as a fundamental scripting language, it forces you to understand how the code actually works, understanding what the library functions expect as inputs and outputs,and how they should be correctly be used.

You can imagine that this creates a brilliant onboarding process for a new collaborator. The collaborator does not need to do so much foundation building, they can get right onto extending the existing system. They will know what the system can do with the typed documentation.

The typed documentation is so good that it is possible to auto-generate a beautiful PDF of documentation of the code with links to each connected component and laid out superbly with very little work. This is done via Typescript's TSDoc.

It is an extension of JavaScript, and therefore should be familiar and easy to pick up if you are used to JavaScript. And if you are from a typed language, it should be a breeze to understand the code base.

Integrating typescript to an existing code base is not too challenging, that is if the code was written well in the first place. Typescript gets transpiled into JavaScript on compilation, so you can work on converting the code base, segments at a time.
