Test driven development that's the name.

1. Think first: Break down the problem at hand. (Whiteboarding)

2. Write tests: Write a test for a single requirement based on your whiteboarding thinking.

3. Write code: Write the most simple solution to pass the test.

4. Cleanup code: Make the code far more readable and maintainable, adhere to any standards you set for your project.

5. Repeat all

How does it work for web?
About the same, however it is necessary to understand that some boilerplate code or simple UI elements need not be tested. (Otherwise, we will not go very far with 100% code coverage; a compromise)

Snapshot testing allows you to ensure UI elements remain in a good working state. ( New changes will prose an error, until accepted)
Jest ( a testing framework that works super well for modern component based JavaScript Frameworks)

Cypress, ensures end-to-end tests are made. Test how your components complement each-other and that the behavioural logic works. A perfect tool to communicate the behaviour of the web application + working state to less technical stakeholders
